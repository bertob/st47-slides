# S&T 47: Why you should get a worse computer
Slides for my talk "Why you should get a worse computer" at the [Speck&Tech 47](https://speckand.tech/2022/11/free-software) meetup.

This is a companion talk to ["Post-Collapse Computing" at SFScon 2022](https://github.com/bertob/sfscon2022-slides).

## Abstract
We’re used to thinking of technology as always progressing, and in terms of hardware that’s definitely true: CPUs are getting more powerful, memory cheaper, networks faster, and so on, forever. But why does it feel like actually using computers is getting slower and shittier? Abundant computing resources and a culture of optimizing for developer productivity above all else have led to a situation where most hardware improvements are instantly negated by software inefficiency. 

This is a problem known from other domains (such as traffic flow), where increasing capacity is paradoxically not reducing but rather increasing the load on the system, resulting in a worse overall outcome. This talk discusses how we could approach this problem as a field, and makes some provocative recommendations — such as getting a worse computer.

## Export
These slides don't need a special export tool, because they're just using Inkscape's new pages feature. They can be exported by just opening the SVG in Inkscape and saving the file as PDF.
